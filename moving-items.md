## Across databases

Moving items is as easy as drag & drop, if you have permission. Because you don;t have permission to move anything wihtin the Tutorials database, we will start by moving things across databases. 

* Select the workbook ``Tutorial  >  01. Welcome  >  2. Deal Data Entry.xlsx`` (you don't have to open it, ust selecting it will display the messages in that location)
* Drag a rectangle across the three messages there to select all three 
    * start to the right and below the last message 
    * hold down the left mouse button and drag the blue rectangle to select all three messages
    * release the left mouse button, the messages stay selected
