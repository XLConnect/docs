EXL Cloud is a partnership between XLConnect and world leading experts in Excel models and dashboards, to bring you prepackaged content connected to Xero out of the box. 

Built on XLConnect, the EXL Cloud workbooks behave like apps that pull in data from Xero. Because they're built in Excel you can easiliy understand how they work as the internals are open, and you can [edit and expand](exl-custom-content.md) them using your existing Excel knowledge.

## Getting started 

If you signed up for [EXL Cloud](http://exlcloud.io) and have installed the add-in, you should see a ``Start Menu`` button on the ``XLConnect ribbon``.

This will quickly populate the report with sample data so you can see what it does. 

Next up, we want to populate the report using your own data, that is explained in section **[Using Workbooks](exl-using-workbooks.md)**.
