Excel is a brilliant piece of software that allows many people, that are not programmers in the traditional sense, solve many of their own reporting and computing needs. When used in teams over longer periods of time however, like monthly reporting processes or the repetitive pricing of contracts, Excel starts to show some weakpoints: 

* used manually which is laborious
* easy to knock over a formula and it is hard to sport these bugs
* versions of spreadsheets are easiliy mixed up when mailing back and forth 
* tracked changes are not very useable 
* copy paste obscures the source of numbers 

This has led many companies to try and replace Excel with other tools and programming languages. These tools however require quite some knowledge and experience to apply which typically means that 'the business' needs to explain their needs to IT who then develop a solution. This requires knowlegde transfer with the risk of misunderstanding. 

These tools are also less productive. What a single person with Excel can develop in a day takes a scrum team of 5 a week. This is why most companies have a deep backlog and are only able to execute some 20% of requests. 

On top of that, the end product is not always tranparent or open to end users and becomes resistive to change while modern business processes require continuous improvement. 

XLConnect offers a new way forward that retains the strengths of Excel while fixing its downsides. XLConnect is platform that extends Excel with feaures for:

* Data Management 
* Automation 
* Version control
* Governance

These solve the concerns above and transorm how Excel can be applied. Workbooks that are developed in Excel can be served with the control and automation that normally comes with applications. This allows business users to continuoulsy adapt and improve 

## Data Management 

Excel cells can be marked as connected to exchange their contents with the NoSQL Datalake. This is an intuitive process that does not require the user to design a database up front, just select cells and click connect. 

By saving data from one spreadheet and loading it into the next, workflows can be created that move large numbers of data a single single action, saving time and removing room for error. 

## Automation 

Large numbers of workbooks can be executed automatically saving even more time, making it possible to update hundreds of workbooks with fresh data daily. 

## Version control

Workbooks can be stored in the Model Library that keeps strict track of different versions and the changes between them. This makes it immediately clear to evryone what version of a workbook they're looking at. It also allows for controlled deployement of workbooks to users to ensure all users are using the intended version. 

## Governance

Financial institutions have policis in place to ensure results are correct. XCLonnects has intergated approvals that allow users to approve data and workbooks. As this adminstration can be reportd over easiliy eliminating a lot of tedious work to try to understand and reproduce numbers.
