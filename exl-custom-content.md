# Creating Custom Content

The great thing from using Excel as our delivery platform is that you already know how to use it. When you open a workbook, all the things you know about Excel still apply. 

This means you can open a workbook from the Content Database, make changes to it. If you're proficient with Excel, you can adapt the workbooks we provide and edit them with

* different logo 
* other color theme (or <a href="https://www.customguide.com/excel/excel-themes" target="_blank">create yourself</a>) 
* Edit, add and delete charts
* Insert new pages with custom calculations to fit requirements.

When you have write access to a ``Subscription Database`` you can save that workbook to EXL Cloud as a 'Connected Workbook'. That means workbook when it is opened again, it can pull current data from cloud systems like Xero. 

Once you store a workbook outside EXL CLoud it will be just another workbook. It still holds the data you pulled, but it is no longer a 'connected workbook' that can pull data off cloud systems.
