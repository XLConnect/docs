The easiest way to open the reports, models and dashboard of EXL Cloud is through the ``Start Page``. 

Alternatively, you can select a workbook directly from the ``Open Workbook`` menu. 

One key feature of EXL Cloud is the ability to pull data from multiple organistaions into a single workbook. This allows you to look across them. 

## Get, Select, Pull

Pulling data from Xero into your workbooks follows the following logic: Get, Select, Pull

* **Get**: Click the ``Get`` button to get the list of Xero organisations 

* **Mark**: mark the organisations you want to pull with an ``x``

* **Pull**: Click the ``Pull`` button to fetch the data from Xero and populate the workbook. 

## Analyzing your data 

After the data has been pulled succesfully, you will jump to some output page. Look for slicers and options along the top for slicing and dicing your data.
